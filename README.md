# LinkedLib
LinkedLib is a easy to use header-only library for data structures based on Linked Lists.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/BigBeakPenguin/LinkedLib.git
```
2. Copy the contents under your project's directory:
3. Compile the headers along your project's files accordingly.

## Usage
Implemented to a proyect of your own by including the header for the DS to be used and compiling accordingly. It supports both primitive and abstract data types (such as structs and classes).

To use, select a LinkedLib DS and simply specify the `type` as well as a undefined variable of the same `type` to pass to its constructor:
```cpp
LinkedList<type> myLinkedList(type());
```
